					Hi.
					<i>Turn on the news.</i><br>
					I already know.<br>
					<i>Those are some big waves, huh?</i><br>
					Yeah.<br>
					…<br>
					So are you just calling to...say goodbye?<br>
					<i>Don't say it like that! That's so dark. You'll probably make it through. Most people have! No need to be so doom-and-gloom about being trapped in your apartment for a couple of days. You've got food, water, backup power. You'll be fine. But yeah, that's why I'm calling.</i><br>
					Thanks. You know, I appreciate that. It helps. All of...this...is so nerve-wracking. But it does help.<br>
					<i>Anytime.</i><br>
					I can see the water rising, I think.<br>
					<i>Oh Jesus, already?</i><br>
					Nononono. It's just, like, a swell. Nothing huge yet. The surface rose maybe...ten feet in the last couple of minutes.<br>
					<i>Okay. How long do you have? Until the Big One?</i><br>
					Um, how am I supposed to know? You think I still have access to the Internet?<br>
					<i>Can't you use mobile data on your phone?</i><br>
					People are using that for important stuff. I'm not gonna slow down the network even more to Google something that I can't change anyway. And before you ask, they're only giving me like five more minutes on Satellyte before they cut me off.<br>
					<i>So hang up now and go check!</i><br>
					Like I said, what's the point? Knowing isn't going to do anything for me. I'd rather spend the time talking to you.<br>
					<i>That's so sweet!</i><br>
					Shut up.<br>
					<i>Ha! Well, we've gotta find something to talk about quickly then, so we don't waste any time. What about...what you're gonna do after all this? When the water recedes?</i><br>
					Go outside, for sure. Maybe take a trip to L.A., go down to the Mojave. Somewhere nice and dry. Then again, that's probably what everyone else is thinking. It's gonna be full of people.<br>
					<i>I bet it's not going to be a desert anymore, and the joke'll be on them! Imagine heading into Death Valley but then you see a giant lake and ferns and palm trees. And they've built a whole, like, a tropical resort there. I mean, I don't know a ton about biology or ecology or whatever, but that could happen, right? It could, hypothetically speaking. And then —</i><br>
					Wait. Wait! Be quiet for just a second.<br>
					<i>What? Why?</i><br>
					Shh.<br>
					…<br>
					The waves. I can feel the building rocking.<br>
					<i>Oh, God.</i>
